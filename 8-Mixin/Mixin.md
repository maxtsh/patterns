# Mixin Pattern

Mixins allow us to easily add functionality to objects without inheritance by injecting functionality into an object's prototype. Modifying an object's prototype is seen as bad practice, as it can lead to prototype pollution and a level of uncertainty regarding the origin of our functions.

React (pre ES6)
Mixins were often used to add functionality to React components before the introduction of ES6 classes. The React team discourages the use of mixins as it easily adds unnecessary complexity to a component, making it hard to maintain and reuse. The React team encouraged the use of higher order components instead, which can now often be replaced by Hooks.
