Fundamentally, a proxy is something or someone that becomes something else’s substitute, so that whatever it is, it has to go through the substitute to reach the real deal. An ES6 proxy works the same way.

Metaprogramming is a powerful technique that enables you to write programs that can create other programs. ES6 made it easier to utilize metaprogramming in JavaScript with the help of proxies and many similar features. ES6 proxies facilitate the redefinition of fundamental operations in an object, opening the door for a wide variety of possibilities.

To effectively implement and use an ES6 proxy, you must understand three key terms:

### ▶ 1- 𝐓𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭: The real deal is that the proxy is substituting, the target is what stands behind the proxy. This can be any object.

### ▶ 2- 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐫: An object that contains the logic of all the proxy’s traps.

### ▶ 3- 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐩: Similar to traps in operating systems, traps in this context are methods that provide access to the object in a certain way.

Data binding is often difficult to achieve due to its complexity. The application of ES6 proxies to achieve two-way data binding can be seen among model-view-controller libraries in JavaScript, where an object is modified when the DOM undergoes a change.
To put it simply, data binding is a technique that binds multiple data sources together to synchronize them.

❌ Performance

ES6 proxies are not ideal for performance-intensive tasks. That’s why it’s crucial to perform the necessary testing. A proxy can be used wherever an object is expected, and the complex functionality that proxies provide with just a few lines of code makes it an ideal feature for metaprogramming.
